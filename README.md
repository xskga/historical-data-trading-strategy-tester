## Position Size Calculation

Uses risk-based position sizing to maintain consistent risk across all trades:

```
Risk Amount ($) = Account Balance √ó (Risk % / 100)
Price Difference = |Entry Price - Stop Loss|
Position Size ($) = Risk Amount / Price Difference
```

**Example:** With $10,000 account, 1% risk, entry at 1.1000, stop at 1.0950:
- Risk Amount = $10,000 √ó 0.01 = $100
- Price Difference = 0.0050
- Position Size = $100 / 0.0050 = **$20,000**

This ensures you always risk exactly 1% regardless of stop distance.
